  <h2> Why Make a Website? </h2>
  <p> This website is designed to tell a little bit about me.
    These aren't secrets, but a few basic traits that make me, me! </p>
  <p> When I was a little boy, I loved building things.
    Legos, K'NEX, Lincoln Logs...you name it and I would build with it.
    I'd use these things to build everything from cars to boats to hospitals.
    But what I loved the most was rocket ships.
    From a young age, my dad taught me about space.
    We were always in awe of the cosmos and learning about what it takes to go there.
    And from there I developed a love for technology.
    To grow, to compete, to advance, we get smarter.
    This is my goal - to learn new skills and paradigms to solve faster, build more, and go further.
    We have so much more to learn about the world! </p>
